To run this project you must make sure your path files are set correctly. When we were running the code we put everything into desktop and it was accessing the files from there. When you run this on your machine you just make sure your path file is correct. Without this step the program will not run!!

In the hive part, the data is accessed though text files and they are included in the zip file as the folder named HIVE data. So you have to include that folder name in the path swell as the main folder BDMFINAL. If these are not included then you will get file not found errors.

The .sql file is in myphpadmin format we were able to export all the data from it.

For the HIVE queries you can just copy and paste the ones provided and verify the data.

Once all this is done then you can run the program. The first 4 buttons are related to the SQL part and will let you insert and delete data. It is required that you fill all the fields to insert and delete the data to avoid adding and deleting accidentally.

The back button takes you back to the selection page and you can use it to change UI's. For the hive part once you click it you have to click the import button to retrieve the data and load it to the table and it is shown.
